<p class="noindent">It seems somewhat extraordinary that although
with persons of great merit and delicacy no virtue
stands in higher estimation than truth, yet, in such
an address as the present, there would be some danger
of offending them by a strict adherence to it; I
mean by uttering truths so generally acknowledged,
that every one, except the person addressed, would
acquit the writer of flattery. And it will be a singular
circumstance to see a Dedication without praise,
to a lady possessed of every quality and accomplishment
which can justly entitle her to it.</p>

<h3>THE ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p>Among the great names which have done honour to antiquity
in general, and to the Roman Republic in particular,
that of Marcus Attilius Regulus has, by the general
consent of all ages, been considered as one of the
most splendid, since he not only sacrificed his labours,
his liberty, and his life for the good of his country, but
by a greatness of soul, almost peculiar to himself, contrived
to make his very misfortunes contribute to that
glorious end.</p>

<p>After the Romans had met with various successes in
the first Punic war, under the command of Regulus,
victory at length declared for the opposite party, the
Roman army was totally overthrown, and Regulus himself
taken prisoner, by Xantippus, a Laced&aelig;monian General
in the service of the Carthaginians: the victorious
enemy exulting in so important a conquest, kept him
many years in close imprisonment, and loaded him with
the most cruel indignities. They thought it was now in
their power to make their own terms with Rome, and determined
to send Regulus thither with their ambassador,
to negotiate a peace, or at least an exchange of captives,
thinking he would gladly persuade his countrymen to
discontinue a war, which necessarily prolonged his captivity.
They previously exacted from him an oath to
return should his embassy prove unsuccessful; at the
same time giving him to understand, that he must expect
to suffer a cruel death if he failed in it; this they
artfully intimated as the strongest motive for him to leave
no means unattempted to accomplish their purpose.</p>

<p>At the unexpected arrival of this venerable hero, the
Romans expressed the wildest transports of joy, and
would have submitted to almost any conditions to procure
his enlargement; but Regulus, so far from availing
himself of his influence with the Senate to obtain any
personal advantages, employed it to induce them to reject
proposals so evidently tending to dishonour their country,
declaring his fixed resolution to return to bondage and
death, rather than violate his oath.</p>

<p>He at last extorted from them their consent; and departed
amidst the tears of his family, the importunites of
his friends, the applauses of the Senate, and the tumultuous
opposition of the people; and, as a great poet of
his own nation beautifully observes, "he embarked for
Carthage as calm and unconcerned as if, on finishing
the tedious law-suits of his clients, he was retiring to
Venafrian fields, or the sweet country of Tarentum."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="big"><b>&#8594;</b></span> This piece is, in many parts, a pretty close imitation
of the <i>Attilio Regolo</i> of Metastasio, but enlarged and
extended into a tragedy of five acts. Historical truth
has in general been followed, except in some less essential
instances, particularly that of placing the return of
Regulus to Rome posterior to the death of his wife.
The writer herself never considered the plot as sufficiently
bustling and dramatic for representation.</p>

<h3>PROLOGUE.</h3>

<h4>WRITTEN BY THE REV. DR. LANGHORNE.</h4>

<div class="center">
 <table style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="text">
<tr><td align="left"><p class="noindent">Deep in the bosom of departed days,<br />
Where the first gems of human glory blaze;<br />
Where, crown'd with flowers, in wreaths immortal drest,<br />
The sacred shades of ancient virtue rest;<br />
With joy they search, who joy can feel, to find<br />
Some honest reason still to love mankind.<br />
There the fair foundress of the scene to-night<br />
Explores the paths that dignify delight;<br />
The regions of the mighty dead pervades;<br />
The Sibyl she that leads us to the shades.<br />
O may each blast of ruder breath forbear<br />
To waft her light leaves on the ruthless air,<br />
Since she, as heedless, strives not to maintain<br />
This tender offspring of her teeming brain!<br />
For this poor birth was no provision made,<br />
A flower that sprung and languish'd in the shade.<br />
On Avon's banks, forsaken and forlorn,<br />
This careless mother left her elder born;<br />
And though unlike what Avon hail'd of yore,<br />
Those giant sons that Shakspeare's banners bore,<br />
Yet may we yield this little offspring grace,<br />
And love the last and least of such a race.<br />
Shall the strong scenes, where senatorial Rome,<br />
Mourn'd o'er the rigour of her patriot's doom;<br />
Where melting Nature aw'd by Virtue's eye,<br />
Hid the big drop, and held the bursting sigh;<br />
Where all that majesty of soul can give,<br />
Truth, Honour, Pity, fair Affection live;<br />
Shall scenes like these, the glory of an age,<br />
Gleam from the press, nor triumph on the stage?<br />
Forbid it, Britons! and, as Romans brave,<br />
Like Romans boast one citizen to save.</p></td></tr>

Five lagging years have crept their tedious round,<br />
And Regulus, alas! is still a slave,<br />

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
